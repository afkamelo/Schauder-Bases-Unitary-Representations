# Schauder Bases via Unitary Representations – Python Codes

This repository contains the Python scripts used to generate the numerical simulations for the paper:

> *On the Construction of Schauder Bases in Hilbert Spaces via Unitary Representations*  

The code reproduces:
- Haar wavelet approximations on finite intervals.
- Fourier series approximations with correct period handling.
- Comparisons between Haar and Fourier reconstructions for:
  - Quadratic functions on \([-3, 3]\),
  - Rectangular waves (period \(T = 1\)),
  - Triangular waves (period \(T = 1\)).
- Error curves and figures used in the numerical results section of the article.

The scripts are organized so that each experiment (quadratic, rectangular, triangular) can be run independently to regenerate the corresponding plots and numerical data.
